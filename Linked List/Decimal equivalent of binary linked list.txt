Given a singly linked list. The link list represents a binary number, ie- it contains only 0s and 1s. Find its decimal equivalent.
The significance of the bits decreases with the increasing index in the linked list. An empty linked list is considered to represent the decimal value 0. 

Since the answer can be very large, the answer modulo 109+7 should be returned.

Examples:

Input: Linked List = 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0

Output: 14
Explanation: 1*23 + 1*22 + 1*21 + 0*20 =  8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 14
Input: Linked List: 0 -> 1 -> 1
Output: 3
Explanation: 0*22 + 1*21 + 1*20 =  1 + 2 + 0 = 3
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1) 


Solution :


long long unsigned int decimalValue(Node *head)
        {
           // Your Code Here
          long long unsigned int d = 0;

        Node *ptr = head;
//1101          7
        while (ptr != NULL)
        {
            // Left shift the current result by 1 and add the current bit
            d = (d << 1) + ptr->data;
            d = d % MOD;

            ptr = ptr->next;
        }

        return d;
           
        }
};
